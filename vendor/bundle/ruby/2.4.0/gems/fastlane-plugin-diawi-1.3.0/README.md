<details><summary>⁺ Explanation</summary><p>
    
From [diawi's documentation](https://dashboard.diawi.com/docs/apis/upload):

> Polling frequence  
> If possible, prefer using the callbacks than the polling: they will always provide you with the result as soon as it is available.
>
> Usually, processing of an upload will take a few seconds: so, a base rule would be to poll every 2 seconds for up to 5 times and should match most simple use-cases.
>
> For larger apps, a longer processing might be needed on our side. A rule of thumb would be to wait up to 1 second for each 10 MB of the app. In other words, up to 10 seconds for a 100 MB app, 50 seconds for a 500 MB app, and so on…
>
> If the status is still 2001 after that duration, there probably is a problem, let us know.

Technically your app can be uploaded to diawi, but still processing for a while. In this case `last_hope_attempts_count` can add extra `n` check status requests.

Example:  
```ruby
last_hope_attempts_count = 3  
app_size = 23 MB  
check_attempts = 23 / 10 + last_hope_attempts_count = 5 # total attempts is 5; but it will return at first success response
```

`lane_context[SharedValues::UPLOADED_FILE_LINK_TO_DIAWI]`

## Example

Minimal plugin configuration is:  
```ruby
diawi(
    token: "your_api_token"
)
```
